# Automatic Vacuum Cleaner with Air Quality Monitoring

## Overview

This project is an **Automatic Vacuum Cleaner** integrated with real-time **Air Quality Monitoring**. It is designed to autonomously clean indoor spaces while simultaneously measuring and displaying air quality levels. The system utilizes an Arduino Uno microcontroller, along with various sensors, to navigate obstacles, monitor particulate matter, and ensure efficient cleaning. The ultimate goal is to enhance indoor air quality and contribute to a healthier living environment.

## How to Implement in Tinkercad
